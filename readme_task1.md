🚗 Clustering Cross-Border Workers

Objective: Create homogeneous travel groups for employees to optimize shared commuting.

Goal: Build a geo-localized clustering system with an interactive map visualization that dynamically adapts to changes in schedules or delays.

📝 Project Description

This project focuses on grouping cross-border workers into shared rides while minimizing detours, delays, and scheduling conflicts.

Step 1: Collect Key Worker Information

For each participant, we gather:

Home location

Workplace location

Typical arrival time at work

Typical departure time from work to home

Step 2: Build Homogeneous Travel Groups

Using the collected data, the system identifies clusters of workers who can share rides.

Workers with similar routes and schedules are grouped together.

The system ensures clusters are as homogeneous as possible to reduce travel inefficiency.

Step 3: Dynamic Reassignment

If a worker reports a delay (sleeping in, shift change), the algorithm reassigns them to a different group or route.

This is done in real-time without disrupting the rest of the cluster.

⚙️ Key Parameters

Departure time

Origin & destination points

Optional flexibility constraints (max detour, max delay tolerance)

💡 Implementation Ideas

Step 1: Find identical or similar workers (same route and schedule) and assign them to the same car.

Step 2: Apply unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to form optimal groups.

Step 3: Incorporate real-time adjustments for late arrivals or schedule changes.

🛠 Tools & Resources

Python for data processing and algorithm implementation

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for route clustering

Interactive map libraries: Folium, Plotly, or Leaflet for visualization

SQLite/PostgreSQL for storing worker data

📈 Workflow Example

Collect worker data: locations and schedules.

Compute clusters of workers with similar home-to-work routes and times.

Assign clusters to cars, minimizing detours and conflicts.

Update clusters dynamically if workers report schedule changes.

🚀 Next Steps

Implement DBSCAN or another clustering algorithm for initial grouping.

Develop real-time reassignment logic for dynamic updates.

Build an interactive map interface to visualize clusters and routes.

Integrate user interface to allow workers to input delays or schedule changes.
